Game Title: Random Chess<br>
<br>
Game Overview:<br>
Random Chess is a strategic chess-based game that introduces unique character traits and probabilities to enhance the gameplay experience. Players engage in a battle of wits, maneuvering their pieces on a standard chessboard to capture the opponent's king.<br>
<br>
Gameplay:<br>
1, Lobby Screen:<br>
Left-click anywhere on the lobby screen to initiate the game.<br>
2, Turn-Based Moves:<br>
Player 1 and Player 2 take turns moving their pieces according to standard chess rules.<br>
Valid moves are highlighted on a yellow grid.<br>
Players can only move on their turn.<br>
3, Piece Capture:<br>
When a piece attempts to capture another, the game calculates success and defense probabilities.<br>
If the attack succeeds, the opponent's piece is eliminated; otherwise, the attacker's piece is removed.<br>
4, Character Traits:<br>
Players are randomly assigned character traits: Hero, Strategist, or Tyrant.<br>
Heroes' kings move like knights, always win in attack positions, and have a higher chance of successful defense.<br>
Strategists have slightly higher probabilities of winning and blocking for all pieces.<br>
Tyrants have standard probabilities but can sacrifice their own pieces to guarantee a victory in the next battle via right-click.<br>
5, Game Conclusion:<br>
The game concludes if a king is captured.<br>
Afterward, players can end the game with a left-click or restart with a right-click.<br>
